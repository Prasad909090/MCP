 a lightweight agentic framework designed to execute real-world tasks using natural language prompts.

MCP enables:

Web-based automation: Booking tickets, shopping online, sending WhatsApp Web messages, and more through browser automation.

Local automation: Performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and generating insights from Excel files.

The core idea is simple: task completion via prompts, powered by an intelligent agent.

I built and tested MCP using Cursor IDE, leveraging Playwright for browser control and OpenAI/Groq for AI responses.
